					<p>
				In 2012, Harvest Gulgaltha first made their presence known with their underground-shaking demo tape, I. Two years later that self-released tape saw a vinyl reissue from Nuclear War Now! While 2014 also saw the release of a compilation of unreleased EPs from the Arizona-based death-doom squad. And that—by working slowly and somehow inconspicuously—is how Harvest Gulgaltha have spent that past half-decade dwelling in profane obscurity.			
		</p>
		<p>
				Like their compatriots Sempiternal Dusk, Harvest Gulgaltha play dreadful, mid-paced to downright crawling death-doom. You’ll find Altars of Devotion, their debut full length, bereft of guitar solos, jarring song structures, astonishing technicality; in essence, there is nothing here to distract the listener from the sickening claustrophobia that these eight tracks conspire to create.

					<p> ruly a mysterious and enigmatic entity, ORDER OF THE NAMELESS ONES released their debut demo in 2014 and have been patiently lying in wait, ready to unleash a full-length of devastating proportions. At last, it has arrived, with the ever-fitting title Utter to Me the Word of Wrath. True to its word, ORDER OF THE NAMELESS ONES here create eight churning 'n' coruscating tracks of cavernous, utterly barbaric DEATH METAL. Their barbarity is familiar in a sense, rooted as it is in the ancient days of the Metal of Death, but the overwhelming onslaught that ensues is suffused with Lovecraftian mythos and modern occultism, altogether creating an obscurity perfectly in line with their moniker. But let it be known that obfuscation, whether for its own sake or otherwise, is nowhere to be found here: ORDER OF THE NAMELESS ONES prize order and stridently exude a militancy that puts Utter to Me the Word of Wrath above the unwashed hordes of no-riff "caverncore," their savage-yet-finessed storm of double-bass blasting and downtuned composition creating a clarity of form. And it works its serpentine, slipstreaming spell the deeper you go into the 29-minute album.
					<br> <br>
					Born in abyssal chaos...sent from the void...to usher in the unknown... Open thy ears to ORDER OF THE NAMELESS ONES and Utter to Me the Word of Wrath.  </p>

				<div class="div-style">
					<a href="harvest-gulgaltha.html">Sjenovik</a>
					<p> Arizona's Sjenovik are a difficult band to categorize, with a name taken out of Slavic lore and a style that really only begins with black metal, and proceeds to journey into a bleak nether realm of noise and structure. Zephaniah follows the interesting Jouissance from last year, and contains another monolithic implication for the future of US black metal. For, like any of my countrymen to better perform this style, they do so by thinking outside the proverbial box, by initiating a wanderlust that captures the flaking decay of their environment, the corroding heart of our culture as we lose further touch with our roots in the name of glorious, crass commercialization, diversity, and the American Way According to MTV™. Sjenovik offers a release from this, at least for 37+ minutes and six tracks of pensive, brooding indulgence.
					<br> <br>
					Highlights: Day of Wrath is perfection, the rest are just, you know, good.
